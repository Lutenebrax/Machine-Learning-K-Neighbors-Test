# Machine Learning - K Neighbors Test


In this project we will use a dataset that contains information like technical aspects about various cars.

Lets try to determine the values required to obtain an accurate model to predict values from a column using the K-nearest Neighbors algorithm.

Information about the dataset can be found in the following link.
